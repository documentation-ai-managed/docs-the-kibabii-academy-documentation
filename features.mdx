## Document Organization

Build a clear hierarchy for your documentation. Create nested folders and pages to mirror your project's structure. Use frontmatter for metadata like titles and descriptions.

<Callout kind="tip">
  Start with a root `docs/` folder and add `index.mdx` for landing pages.
</Callout>

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Root Folder] --> B[Getting Started]
    A --> C[API Reference]
    B --> D[Installation]
    B --> E[Quickstart]
    C --> F[Endpoints]
    C --> G[Authentication]
```

Customize sidebar navigation by editing `sidebar.json` or using auto-generation based on folder structure.

## Editing and Formatting Tools

Edit documents directly in the browser with MDX support. Leverage components like `<Callout>`, `<Steps>`, and code blocks for rich content.

</CodeGroup>

## Search and Navigation

Find content quickly with full-text search across all pages. Use breadcrumbs, table of contents, and customizable sidebars for effortless browsing.

| Feature | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Full-Text Search | Indexes titles, headings, and body text | Query: `authentication flow` |
| Breadcrumbs | Shows current path | Home > API > Endpoints |
| Auto-TOC | Generates table of contents from headings | Links to H2/H3 sections |
| Keyboard Shortcuts | `Ctrl+K` for search, `?` for help | Speeds up navigation |

Integrate custom search with Algolia or use the built-in engine for instant results.
